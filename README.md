# TOTP.js
A Javascript class for generating TOTP passwords (time-based one-time passwords) automatically (think Google Authenticator).
OTP is calculated based on a provided 16-character key (secret).
This is the open-source algorithm that Google Authenticator and other 2FA-enabled apps utilize.
This script is based on a code snippet published by user "russ" on http://blog.tinisles.com.

This class requires sha.js, which can be found here: http://caligatio.github.io/jsSHA/sha.js
 
# Usage Example:
 
`var totp = new TOTP('user secret', 'optional user name for display'); // Instantiates object and keeps it alive in DOM`

## Getters:

`totp.getOTP()` - Returns current OTP
`totp.getQR()` -  Returns URL to Google Charts QR Code (for scanning into Google Authenticator)
`totp.getCountDown()` - Returns time (in seconds) until next OTP update

## Setters:

`totp.setKey(secretKey)` - Sets 16-digit user secret (key)
`totp.setLog(true|false)` - Sets logging output to console.log()
`totp.getUser(username)` - Sets username display (for QR code), default is "user@example.com" if not set
